# Old-IE-Support-Portfolio

This version of the responsive portfolio uses flex for modern browsers, and pure media queries for IE 9 and below.

Note: It is currently nonfunctional in IE 8 and below due to a lack of support for semantic tags in those versions.

To see the media queries in action (specifications per the assignment), open the index.html file in Internet Explorer, pres F12 to open the developer console, and use the dropdown in the toolbar to switch from "Edge (default)" to "IE 9".  It will then switch to the oldstyles.css file instead of styles.css.
